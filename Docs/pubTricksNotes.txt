Data - Video 4

Baby steps to get things right.	
	
A user views a Trick video and reveal video 
A Trick can be in a Category
	

Write tests to help guide thinking
	**this is really good**

Then share with team and get feedback


ORM
	EF
		Guids as PK's.... Rob doesn't like
	MVC Scaffolding
	Massive
	

Controlers - RESTfully

Developing up /tricks controller
	Doing it manually
	
	Templates changing

Using own html helper methods
	
	
validation thoughts

front end wire in
like functionality

authentication wire in for admin

build out test cases and look for edge cases 
get lots of content on the site!	

contact page.
---------------
Massive

getting into the heart of it and stripping it back

get tests passing again

build up Massive from the ground

get controller working simply with no cruddy abstraction.

Create
	Votes in database isn't going through from create to db
	Likes on screen, but @Model.Votes in view.
	FormCollection is coming though as Likes
	
Create not working in VidPub original
	download again.
	not working in downloaded version

----
See what Rob has to say in Video5
	
unobtrusive validation

authentication on controller


make front end pull from database tricks table
	simple razor syntax

why js?  Write less server code, and write a more compelling and responsive application.

jquery templates to help display on the frontend?
	
make an ApplicationController to handle auth?
